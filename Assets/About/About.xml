	<description>A rebellious movement against the empire, fighting a guerilla warfare to free slaves and defeat the high stellarch. Though lacking the empire's ultratech tools, the rebels are tenacious and full of bloody determinism.\n\nThis mod features a new faction with unique rewards and permits in exchange for weapons and trophies from dead imperials. New furniture, new quests, new anti-armour weapons, pain-killers and incense, and even new music to get you in a rebellious mood.</description>
